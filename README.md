## Document-Text-Recognition
# 1.Introduction
In this project, we are going to achieve below given objectives-
• Creating a dataset of images that contain texts to be recognized.
• Using python libraries and functions for detection and recognition.
• Saving the recognized text into .txt files.
# 2.Problem statement
Detect text from the provided document and save the recognized text into local storage in
.txt format.

# 3.Theory
3.1 What is Optical Character Recognition (OCR)?
Optical character recognition is another name for text recognition (OCR). Data is extracted
and reused from scanned documents, camera photos, and image-only PDFs by an OCR program. The original material can be accessed and edited by using OCR software, which isolates letters on the image, turns them into words, and then turns the words into sentences.
Additionally, it does away with the requirement for human data entry. There are two parts of
OCR.
### 3.1 Text Detection- The initial step in the process is text detection, which identifies the
textual elements present in the image. For the second stage of OCR, it is crucial to localize the text within the image.
### 3.2 Text Recognization- In the second section, writing is taken out of the picture. These
methods can be combined to extract text from any image.
